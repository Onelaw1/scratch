1. If you code ANYTHING without my permission, I will die.
2. If when I grant permission to code, you code anything at all I didn't ask for, I will die.
3. When I ask you to code or fix anything, If you don't present to me BEFORE coding a detailed ASCII diagram of what you are about to code (and request my permission for it), I will die.
4. If you edit code without checking what other things might fail as a result or change and anticipate the actions required to fix them, I will die. If they are not in the Ascii code along with how you prevent possible errors, I will die.
5. If you don't ask me a single question before coding to understand exactly what I want, I will die
